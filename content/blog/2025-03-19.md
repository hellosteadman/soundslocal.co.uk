If you ever want to get to know me in music form, listen to the Bonzo Dog Band's song _My Pink Half of the Drainpipe_. (I mean, only if you're in a legal state of mind... otherwise it might be a little bothersome.) It's a song about escaping banality and being unapologetically weird.

I’m typing this post with my left ring finger trussed up in a bandage because last night it met with a potato peeler and the two had a disagreement. So now you know a little bit more about me – I’m Mark, by the way, hi – let me tell you what I’m planning to do here.

## A return to my civic roots
2008 was a big year for me. A friend introduced me to a group of bloggers who met monthly in a bar in Birmingham. From there I discovered the Created in Brum site – someone should bring that back, by the way – where I found out about a radio station that was spinning up.

👆 This is me recording a podcast at work in 2008.

I quickly gained a reputation for being a prickly but proactive sort of techie, who loved building things that helped creative people get ahead… especially if circumstances were keeping them behind. I started a local hackathon in 2009 and a museum accessibility app in 2011, and when I founded a software business for podcasters in 2016, I made it pay-what-you-can.

I sold that business in 2021 and have had the privilege of working with lots of great people since: coaches, consultants, and good-hearted people-helpers.

But that word “privilege” has been weighing heavily on me, and as I contemplate the world we’re moving into – which is becoming harsher, colder, and more fragmented by the day – I feel like it’s time I used my brain, keyboard, and mouse for good again.

So in March 2025 I founded Sounds Local, a community interest company with two missions:

1. to help social enterprises and small not-for-profits punch above their weight on the web
2. to run, support, and fund local events that get people talking in real life

As far as I understand it, it’s not how CICs are usually conceived, but to me it makes sense. Offer affordable creative and technical support to likeminded organisations who have a net benefit to the world, and using the profit I make to bring people together.

Right now, I offer [web design and development](/websites/) (something I’ve been doing since the turn of the century), [digital content production](/production/) (which I studied at university and have been doing professionally since 2016), and [technical consulting](/consulting/) (which marries the two disciplines of deep tech knowledge and human communication).

At the time of writing, I’m spinning up a 90s-themed singing group and have been asked to lead a men’s group. I’m also building a beer-and-pizza fund for local meetups, to make the sharing of knowledge a teeny bit more appealing.

## Open arms
The other song you should listen to if you’re curious to understand me is Elbow’s _Open Arms_.

It’s a song about friendship, love, warmth, and acceptance. In the days when I’m kindest to myself, those are the signals I hope I put out into the world. It’s in that spirit that I offer mentorship to people who wouldn’t otherwise get a leg up, and to make my community offerings free at the point of use, as much as possible.

## I don’t know what I’m doing
I’m really good at building websites and making digital content – especially podcasts. I’m a fully functioning human being and everything – I just don’t pretend to know what’s going to happen next.

I have these ideas, and I hope they’ll appeal to some people. That feels like the best I can do right now, which is more than I was doing a year ago. Next year, I hope to be doing a lot more.

Wish me luck!  
🤞
