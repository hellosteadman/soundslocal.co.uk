# C90 Community Chorus

C90 is a singing group based in Stirchley, Birmingham. Itâ€™s open to adults who want to come together and sing 90s songs for fun, to make new friends, and potentially to perform in low-stakes environments.

The community will benefit from access to a weekly two-hour session where they can meet and interact with people local to them.

The planned venue is wheelchair accessible, and sessions are inclusive and psychologically safe. Group singing provides a physical and psychological release, allows people to express themselves outside of speech, and promotes a sense of connectedness over individualism.
