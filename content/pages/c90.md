# C90 Community Chorus

=== SECTION ===

C90 is a weekly singing group based in Stirchley, Birmingham. It’s open to people from 18 up who want to come together and sing 90s songs for fun, to make new friends, and maybe to perform the odd gig in public.

**We'll be starting weekly sessions in mid April.**

=== ACCORDION ===

## Do I need to know how to read music?

Absolutely not! We learn songs through call-and-response repetition, so if you can read lyrics, that'll help, but you don't need any musical knowledge whatsoever.

## How much does it cost?

We ask members to pay £5 per session, but we'll take whatever you can afford. If that means £0, that's what you pay.

## Do you perform for the public?

It's early days yet, but we're not ruling it out. Members will be invited to play some chilled, low-stakes environments, but if that doesn't sound like fun, you won't be pressured into performing.
