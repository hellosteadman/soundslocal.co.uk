# Your tech-to-human translator.

=== INTRO SECTION ===

## Every industry has its gatekeepers

Most industries, from accounting to medicine, have their own vernacular and terms of art. Digital is no different, but we interact with tech every day, and we're increasingly asked to learn new tools or find new ways to bring offline programmes online.

When that happens, it can be useful to have a guide with you, who understands the 0s and 1s, but can turn tech specs into action plans everyone can get behind.

=== BIO SECTION ===

### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

I've worked as a technical lead for creative endeavours since 2008. I studied Media & Communication and have a top-performing weekly podcast that communicates dry topics in an engaging and â€“ dare I say â€“ entertaining way.

If you're excited by tech but don't know the ins-and-outs, I'd be delighted to show you how everything works. Equally, if you see IT as a problem you just want taken off your todo list, I'm here to help.

## Digital strategy

![Strategy](img/consulting-strategy.jpg)

If you've engaged a branding or design team on a refit of your website, I can work with your in-house technical team and balance everyone's requirements so you have a smooth-running project where everyone feels heard.

I can

- Act as a bridge between designers, developers, and stakeholders
- Translate technical jargon into clear, actionable tasks
- Ensure digital strategy aligns with your organisational goals

## Project management

![Agile](img/consulting-agile.jpg)

Having bulit and sold my own software-as-a-service product, and worked across technical and creative teams, I'm adept at breaking down big technical goals into manageable tasks.

I can

- Help define a clear, realistic roadmap for development
- Identify the right tools and platforms for your needs
- Support teams in adopting best practices without unnecessary complexity

## AI and automation

![AI](img/consulting-ai.jpg)

Large language models aren't just for cheating on homework. I help small teams and community organisations use AI tools like ChatGPT, Notion, and image generation in meaningful, ethical ways. Not to replace human creativity, but to augment it.

I can help you

- Automate repetitive tasks to free up valuable time
- Implement AI tools to enhance communication and outreach
- Ensure AI is used responsibly, with clear human oversight

## Training

![Training](img/consulting-training.jpg)

Digital tools should work for you, not against you. I help teams find the right software and processes that fit their workflow.

I'll help you

- Assess your needs and recommend the best solutions
- Train your team on using new tools effectively
- Simplify complex systems into intuitive processes
