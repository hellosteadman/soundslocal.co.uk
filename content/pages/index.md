## Hiya üëã I'm Mark

I've been building websites since the turn of the century. I've worked as tech lead for a number of marketing firms in the health and cultural sectors, as well as volunteering on community radio projects.

Since going freelance in 2016, I've worked with BT Sport, the BBC, Amazon, Mozilla and more, lending my technical chops, training, and consultation.

## Connecting people in the real world

Polarising social media, disillusionment, and the rise of remote work, among other factors, contribute to social isolation and loneliness.

The Internet is a powerful way to connect people who wouldn't otherwise meet. But if time on Zoom and social media isn't balanced with real world interaction ‚Äì especially with people who don't look like us ‚Äì our worldview gets smaller.

Sounds Local is a community interest company, meaning the profit it generates is put back into the community to fund projects that get people off screens and out into the world.
