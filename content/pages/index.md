## Hiya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

I've been building websites since the turn of the century, and producing podcasts since before they were cool... and long after.

I host a hit podcast and a TikTok series, I've worked with BT Sport, the BBC, Amazon, Mozilla and more... and I once went semi-viral by duetting with the voice of the parrot in Aladdin.

## Let's embrace the awkward

The Internet is a powerful way to connect people who wouldn't otherwise meet. But if we don't balance time on Zoom and social media with real-world interaction â€“ especially with people who don't look like us â€“ our worldview gets smaller.

Sounds Local is a Community Interest Company, meaning the profit it makes is put back into the community to fund projects that get people off screens and out into the world, with all its messy unpredictability.
