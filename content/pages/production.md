# Your story, in your own words.

## What a podcast can do for you

Weâ€™re open to deeper connection and more emotive experiences because podcasts come along with us, whether weâ€™re commuting, walking the dog, or having a moment to ourselves before bed.

The key to a successful podcast is in providing authentic human connection, whether thatâ€™s with you or a wider community.

Podcasting is a long game, so while a launch can give us a good head start, the magic is in putting one episode in front of the other, and letting your efforts compound.

### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

Since 2016, I've worked with best-selling authors, entrepreneurs, artists, and TV personalities. My work has been showcased by the BBC, and I created the British Podcast Awards Bullseye category.

I started the Birmingham Podcast Festival, sold a successful podcast tech business, and produced a murder mystery podcast in under 15 minutes, live on stage. Twice.

You might be doing big and important work, but that doesn't mean the creative process has to be weighty. Not only am I confident you'll enjoy recording and releasing episodes, but we'll have fun working on this together.

## Here's what we'll do together

1. ### Build a listener persona
   With your help, Iâ€™ll create a psychographic profile of your ideal listener, focusing on their personality, their values, and their spheres of influence.

2. ### Write your listener story
   Iâ€™ll craft a single sentence that distils your listener persona, the intent of the podcast, and the benefit itâ€™ll bring them.

3. ### Position the podcast
   Iâ€™ll evaluate the landscape and home in on what will make your podcast stand out in a crowded market.

4. ### Craft sound & feel
   Weâ€™ll co-design a basic structure, so episodes deliver maximum listener benefit and clear calls-to-action.

5. ### Plug in & turn on
   Iâ€™ll ship the gear you need (included in the price), and give you the training to use a mic like a professional.

6. ### Put a team together
   If you donâ€™t want to go it alone, Iâ€™ll help you find someone who can edit your audio to a high standard.

7. ### Soft launch to beta listeners
   Weâ€™ll gather a small group of listeners whose feedback will help us iterate and improve the show.

8. ### Find your first 1,000 listeners
   Iâ€™ll help you put together a growth plan for how you can attract and retain listeners and build to your 1,000 true fans.
