# Your audience is waiting to hear from you.

=== INTRO SECTION ===

## Discovery vs retention

Long-form content, like a blog or newsletter, is there to build trust and affinity within the people you want to reach. But they can't help you find new people.

Social media apps like Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn and Substack, show our work to new audiences. As people engage with that content (liking posts, adding comments, visiting our profiles), our work is shown to more people.

It can feel tempting to show a slick and professional side on social media, but unblemished and over-polished content is less relatable.

=== BIO SECTION ===

### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

I've been an early adopter of pretty much every social network you can think of (remember Peach? Or Path? How about Plurk?), and although the landscape has changed massively, the fundamentals remain:

**Be human.**

The stuff I've gone viral for has never been the work that was slaved over... it was the stuff that was fun, that felt spontaneous, and that had no agenda.

=== ATTENTION SECTION ===

## Getting attention is easy

An effective social media strategy doesn't mean jumping on the latest trend, chasing algorithm chances, or obsessing over hashtags.

For community-led organisations, it's simply about maintaining a constant touch point â€“ letting people know what you're up to, telling the stories of the people you're helping, and encouraging people to follow their own curiosity.
