## What your website says about you

Your website is more than just the place people to go find your contact details. It's where you get to share your achievements, where people can meet and join your team, and where the content you create can live without being filtered through an algorithm.

When someone searches for you, your website's design and performance â€“ how fast it loads and how enjoyable it is to use â€“ form an important first impression.

That old line about "never getting a second chance to make a first impression" is a clichÃ© for a reason. We often form snap judgements of people and organisations within the first few seconds.

A fast, user-first website gives you the best chance of making that first impression count.

## What is a "user-first" website?

As teams grow, each department wants to see themselves and their hard work represented on the website. Just like every funder wants their logo at the bottom of every page... and as big as possible!

It's completely understandable. People put their hard work and money behind worthwhile projects and want to it represented somewhere.

Before long, the website begins serving the people who made it, rather than the community who benefit from what you provide.

### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark

I've spent 20 years in digital marketing, working on tiny projects and nationwide government initiatives.

I've spent the last decade helping independent content creators launch and grow their brands, and the biggest thing I've learned is that everything we do is in service of one question:

## So what?

Everything we write, every podcast we record, every email we send out, invites someone to take action. That could be coming to an event, donating to keep the lights on, or just telling a friend about the work we're doing.

The wording, fonts, colours... everything needs to be in-line to communicate a simple idea and to make your website visitor's next action obvious and easy.

## But this sounds anything _but_ easy

I hear that. But the good news is, I've spent 25 years doing this, which means I've made a tonne of mistakes, and when I've been successful, I've tried to understand why.

I want to bring everything I've learned about digital marketing and website building to social enterprises. Let's work together on building something simple, long-lasting, and most-importantly, effective.
